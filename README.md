Welcome to Financial Machine Learning in Python! 

This package is used to apply machine learning methods to financial data, which generally has very low SNR(signal to noise ratio) and thus hard to apply ML directly. You can find more detailed explaination of methods implemented in this package in [Advances in Financial Machine Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XUr7phuMCQxBKyqFxeVcL2sOCRe5dq7Z/view?usp=sharing). Also you can find R version of this package at [fmlr](https://github.com/larryleihua/fmlr). 

p.s. You can also call this package --  *For My Love Perfect You*
## Framework
This package included four modules listed below  

+ __preprocessing__  
    Used to preprocess raw price series. Including generate all kinds of structured bars, meta-labelling, generate fractionally differentiated series etc.
+ __model__  
    Used to train machine learning models. Mainly deal with cross-validation and sequential boostrap method. Also implemented random forest model here.
+ __backtest__  
    Used to back test quantatitive investment strategies.   
    __* This module will not be included in version 1.0__
+ __tests__  
    Used to test the correctness of the code during development and provide examples to users after the package is deployed. 
## Dependecy
+ pandas 0.24.1


## Installation
